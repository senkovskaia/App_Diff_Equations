## Differential Equations App

This a **Streamlit** application that is part of the **bachelor's thesis of Klavdiia Senkovskaia**, designed to interactively demonstrate solutions to differential equations using power series. It focuses on providing an interactive approach to solving differential equations using:

1. **Power Series Method**

2. **Frobenius Method**

It provides interactive inputs, symbolic computations using **SymPy**, and visual plots using **Plotly**.

## Features
- Compute coefficients for power series solutions using symbolic differentiation.
- Solve linear differential equations with variable coefficients.
- Recurrence relations for finding coefficients of power series expansions.
- Interactive visualization of solutions using numerical approximation.
- Handles different cases of the Frobenius method, including singular points.

## Hosted Application

This application is hosted on **Streamlit Community Cloud** and can be accessed here:
